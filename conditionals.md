# Conditionals

Conditionals is a way for a computer to handle decisions. Given some condition the program should be able to account for that. This is done using something called a conditions conditional statement. 

Before we talk about conditional statments lets talk about the type `boolean`



## Conditional statements

Conditional statments is the mechanism for which a computer takes decisions. The most typical conditional statement is a **if sentence**. Lets look at an example



### If sentence

```java
boolean isSunShining = true;
if (isSunShining) {
  System.out.println("The sun is shining ☀️");
}
```

Here we first define the `boolean` variable `isSunShining` to be `true`. Then we comes the if sentence. Only if `isSunShining` is `true` the code within the brackets (`{}`) will be executed.
