# Conditionals

Conditionals is a way for a computer to handle decisions. Given some condition the program should be able to account for that. This is done using something called a conditions conditional statement. 

Before we talk about conditional statments lets talk about the type `boolean`



## Boolean

A boolean is a Java type that stores either `true` or `false`. Lets say we want to create a `boolean` variable that stores if the weather is shining today. We would do that like this:

````java
// here we declare the variable isSunShining as a boolean
boolean isSunShining;
// depending on the weather we either set it to true or false
// lets say the sun is shining
isSunShining = true;
````



### Boolean expressions

What if we had a variable called `televisionPrice` that we wanted to check was expensive. We could fx say that prices larger than 10000 is an expensive price. In Java we would do that like this:

```java
int televisionPrice = 12000;
// > reads as "is larger than"
boolean isTelevisionExpensive = televisionPrice > 10000;
System.out.println(isTelevisionExpensive); // true
```



There are 6 different boolean expressions:

- `x == y` - x is equal to y
- `x != y`  - x is not equal to y
- `x > y` - x is greater than y
- `x < y` - x is less than y
- `x >= y ` - x is greater than or equal to y
- `x <= y` - x is less than or equal to y









a person is higher than 2 meters. So this means
