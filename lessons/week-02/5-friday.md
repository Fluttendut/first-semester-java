### Exercise 1:

 Write a Java program that determines a studentâ€™s grade. The program will read three types of scores(quiz, mid-term, and final scores) and determine the grade based on the following rules: 

- if the average score >=90% =>grade=A 
- if the average score >= 70% and <90% => grade=B 
- if the average score>=50% and <70% =>grade=C 
- if the average score<50% =>grade=F

See the example output below: 

Quiz score: 80

Mid-term score: 68

Final score: 90

Your grade is B



### Exercise 2: 

Write a Java program to calculate the revenue from a sale based on the unit price and quantity of a product input by the user. The discount rate is 10% for the quantity purchased between 100 and 120 units, and 15% for the quantity purchased greater than 120 units. If the quantity purchased is less than 100 units, the discount rate is 0%. See the example output as shown below:

Enter unit price: 25 

Enter quantity: 110 

The revenue from sale: 2475.0$ 

After discount: 275.0$(10.0%)
