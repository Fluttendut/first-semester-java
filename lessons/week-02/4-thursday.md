## Crypto converter!

We are joining the crypto train, choo choo everybody aboard 🚂☁️☁️☁️☁️

Let's make a Java program that works like this👇

Firstly it will ask for the firstname and then lastname

Then it will greet the user with a welcoming (and not too threatening) message!

Now the user can write how many dollars the user wants to convert into crypto

Finally the program will output how many crypto coins the user can get with different currencies. Here is an example of the output 👇

```
What is your firstname?
```

Now the user puts in his/her firstname. In this example `Benjamin`

```
What is your surname?
```

Now the user puts in his/her firstname. In this example `Hughes`

```
Welcom dear Benjamin Hughes ❤️
Here is a random character in your fullname: g
Anyways we hope you're ready to convert some dollars
How many dollars can you convert today?
```

Now the user writes how many dollars he/she has. In this case 34 dollars

```
Wauv 34 dollars thats a lot 💵
Here is what you can get with 34 dollars
- 0.000234 bitcoin
- 0.1334 dogecoin
- 2.423 scamcoins
In total that is 2.556634 coins in total!
```

This line: `Here is a random character in your fullname: g` should take a random character in the fullname and show it. This will require some googling since you have not learned this!! Think about what you can Google

This line `In total that is 2.556634 coins in total!` should add all the cryptocoins together (even though that does not really make any sense 😂)

\*\* I have no idea if those are the correct conversions



*Optional taks*: If the user 

- Puts in from 0-10 dollars we should print `7 dollars why not more?`
- Puts in from 10-40 dollars we should print `34 dollars, well done`
- Puts in from 40-100 dollars we should print `Wauv 97 dollars thats a lot 💵`
