## Exercises



### Exercise 1

Write a Java program to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence from a given unsorted array of integers.

Sample array: `[49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5]`The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, therefore the program will return its length 5.



### Exercise 3

Write a Java program to separate even and odd numbers of a given array of integers. Put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers



### Exercise 4

Write a Java program to check if a given array contains a subarray with 0 sum. 

Example:

Input :

```
nums1= { 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums2 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums3 = { 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6 }
```

Output:Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true

Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: false

Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true



### Exercise 5

Write a Java program to find maximum product of two integers in a given array of integers. 

Example:

Input :

nums = { 2, 3, 5, 7, -7, 5, 8, -5 }

Output:

Pair is (7, 8), Maximum Product: 56
