### Part two - Rock Paper Scissors

You have to create a rock, paper, scissors game. The game should have two modes:

1. Multiplayer - person vs person
2. Singleplayer - person vs computer



### Multiplayer

When playing in the multiplayer mode, the game should ask for the two players name. 

Now the users will play 3 rounds. After the rounds a message should be printed that shows either who won or a message saying the game was a draw. 



### Singleplayer

When playing in singleplayer mode the user is playing against a computer. The user puts in his name and they now play three rounds. After the rounds a message should be printed that shows either who won or a message saying the game was a draw. 



#### Player decides number of rounds

Let the player decide the number of rounds



### *Optional tasks*

#### No draws

Make it so two players (person vs person and person vs computer) has to find a winner in each round. No draws!



#### Intelligent computer

Instead of just randomnly choosing sign (rock, paper or scissors). Look at the history of the other player and make a better informed selection. You could fx check

- Which sign does the oponent use the most?
- Which signs does the user play after he has played another sign. Fx he often plays rock after he has played scissor
- Which signs does the user play after the opponent played another sign. Fx he often plays rock after the oponent played scissor
- Maybe a combination
- Try do some research on the topic:

#### Rounds

Instead of just playing 10 games, what people often do is play 3 plays and then does a best of three games. Now you dont win by having most correct guesses but won the most games.

*What if the game ends in a draw? Is that okay or should the finish to they have found a winner?*
