## Face creator

In this exercise we will be using FeelJava to create a method that can generate a face. You can watch a small video about FeelJava here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRSCFqIvUOo

Download FeelJava here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ji2fmthdm5a2eh/feeljava0.7.jar?dl=1

Open FeelJava and in the top, click on `graphics -> Circle`. Here is an example of how to draw a circle

Create a method that can generate a face. The method should have relevant parameters that control the face. This is a very open task and you choose how to do it. Creativity is appreciated ü§© 

Try and use as much as you have learned so far (types, loops, methods (obviously), reading inputs)



Here is an example of how a method could look. 

```java
public void generateFace(boolean isSmiling, int numberOfEyes, String hairColor) {
   	...
}
```

To figure out how to draw different shapes take a look at this article: https://edencoding.com/javafx-canvas/ or this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaXuK-RsT6E

Consider using more than one method! fx `drawNose`, `drawHair`

## Handing in

The project should be handed in on fronter using GitHub. 

We will find a judge that will find the best face, and there will be a small price üèÜ
