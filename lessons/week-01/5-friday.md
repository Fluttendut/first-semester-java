## Hello Intellij

Today we are progressing to a professional work environment called Intellij. 

Intellij is a professionel development tool for writing programs. It is one of the most popular tools for java and we will be using this Integrated Development Environment (IDE) throughout the semester. 

It is recommended to use **Intellij Ultimate Edition** which is a premium solution (meaning you have to pay for a license)

You **do** have a license for Intellij Ultimate Edition - activate it by registering with your KEA e-mail.
