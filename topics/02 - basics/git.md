# GIT

Comparison with saving a word document



git add . and git commit -m "asd" is like save in a word document



Imagine that instead of saving, you would have lots of changes and then package the individual changes

- This change is related to writing and intro
- This change is related to writing an outro



Git add is saying which changes you want to save. Git commit is packaging them in a small container called a commit. 



git push origin master is syncing with the cloud!
