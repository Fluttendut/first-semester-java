# 4 pillars of OOP

Java has 4 pillars it is built upon ðŸ‘‡



![4 pillars of OOP](../../assets/4-pillars-of-oop.png)



Lucky for you we have already talked about 2 out of the 4 pillars. That is:

- Abstraction - Abstraction is about abstracting code away. This can be achieved by creating methods, creating an `Interface` or an `Abstract` class. 
- Inheritance - The inheritance pillar is obvioulsy about inheritance and how objects can inherit properties from another object



The 2 pillars we have not talked about are

- Encapsulation - How we can control what objects can see and interact with data inside another object. 
- Polymorphism - How methods and classes can act in different ways. It means one name many forms. 



Let's first talk about Encapsulation!



## Encapsulation

Let's again use the `User` class from earlier!

```java
public class User {
    public String username;
    public String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String generateNewPassword() {
        return "asd123";
    }
}
```

You have learned about most of creating a class but we have not talked about the `public ` keyword. 

`public` is a access modifier that tells Java who have access to the attribute. In this example `username`, `password` and `UserInheritance` (the constructor) and `generateNewPassword` are public. That means that all those attributes and methods can be called on the object.

```java
User mieParker = new User("Mie Parker", "fairydust");
System.out.println(mieParker.username); // Mie Parker
System.out.println(mieParker.password); // fairydust
System.out.println(mieParker.generateNewPassword()); // asd123
```

Accessing the attributes `username` and `password` is not good because all the data that is inside the `mieParker` object can be accessed by everone that has the object. 



### Let's improve this using encapsulation

```java
public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String generateNewPassword() {
        return "asd123";
    }
}
```

Now we have used the access modifier `private` instead. This means that `username` and `password` now only can be accessed within the class!

```java
User mieParker = new User("Mie Parker", "fairydust");
System.out.println(mieParker.username); // Java error
System.out.println(mieParker.password); // Java error
System.out.println(mieParker.generateNewPassword()); // asd123
```

So what if we still want to access or change `username` or `password` from outside the class using an object. Then we use getter's and setter's



### Getters and setters



#### Getter method

Getter methods are methods that give access to the some `private` attribute. 

```java
public String getUsername() {
	return username;
}
```

It's simply a method that returns the `private` attribute. 



#### Setter method

Setter methods are methods that give access to set/change some `private` attribute. 

```java
public void setUsername(String username) {
  this.username = username;
}
```

It is a method that changes the `private` attribute. 



#### Let's use it

```java
User mieParker = new User("Mie Parker", "fairydust");
System.out.println(mieParker.getUsername()); // Mie Parker
mieParker.setUsername("mieP");
System.out.println(mieParker.getUsername()); // MieP
```



### Encapsulation best practice

How should you then use this moving forward?

Here are some best practices ðŸ‘‡

- **Always** set all attributes as `private`
- Make getter and setter methods for the relevant attributes. Consider each one!
- Think about access modifiers for methods. If a method should only be used within the class, make it `private`. Otherwise make it `public`



Another example: A User that has a cpr attribute should not be changed



### Final user version

```java
public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String generateNewPassword() {
        return "asd123";
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }
}
```





## Polymorphism

GÃ¥ igennem en liste af objekter der overholder et interface. Kalde deres metode. Metoderne opfÃ¸rer sig forskelligt slev om de hedder det samme
